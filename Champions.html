            <ul>
                <li><a href="https://u.gg/lol/champions/mordekaiser/build" target="blank">Mordekaiser:</a>He’s easy and fun to play and also strong. In pro-play he is a monster. And his ultimate ability is one of the strongest.</li>
                <li><a href="https://u.gg/lol/champions/jax/build" target="blank">Jax:</a>He is an interesting one. He has one unique ability, but with all abilities he is a monster too. You can buy any items with him, and still be really strong.</li>
                <li><a href="https://u.gg/lol/champions/nasus/build" target="blank">Nasus:</a>He can stack his “q” ability. If you reach 1500,  you will have a lot of damage. If you reach 3000 and activate your ultimate, you are unkillable.</li>
                <li><a href="https://u.gg/lol/champions/garen/build" target="blank">Garen:</a>He is one of the strongest top-laners, he can spin and do lots of damage. If you buy tank items with him you will be unkillable.</li>
                <li><a href="https://u.gg/lol/champions/teemo/build" target="blank">Teemo:</a>He is really annoying if you play against him, but if you play with him, it can be really fun. </li>

            <ul>
                <li><a href="https://u.gg/lol/champions/masteryi/build" target="blank">Master Yi:</a>His q ability is really overpowered, and with his w ability he can heal himself. And if you activate your ultimate and activate your q ability you can easily kill someone.</li>
                <li><a href="https://u.gg/lol/champions/warwick/build" target="blank">Warwick:</a>He is one of the best junglers in the game, his passive is a ton of lifesteal. If you build him and play him right, he can easily do a triplekill or better. </li>
                <li><a href="https://u.gg/lol/champions/amumu/build" target="blank">Amumu:</a>He is as good as his support version, he is really overpowered, cheap, and easy to use.</li>
                <li><a href="https://u.gg/lol/champions/volibear/build" target="blank">Volibear:</a>He is a top-laner too, his ultimate is like nasus’, but better. In jungle, he can do good ganks(when a jungler goes to help his teammates in a lane).</li>
                <li><a href="https://u.gg/lol/champions/trundle/build" target="blank">Trundle:</a>He’s really op in jungle and on top-lane too. I doesn’t like to play against him, because of his ailities are really op.</li>

                <li><a href="https://u.gg/lol/champions/talon/build" target="blank">Talon:</a>He’s really op in jungle too, but I prefer him in mid. His passive is like ignite, with his ultimate you can be invisible, if you don’t hit an enemy.</li>
                <li><a href="https://u.gg/lol/champions/ahri/build" target="blank">Ahri:</a>If you play her good, she can be one of the best characters. She can be really annoying, or the easiest enemy of your life.</li>
                <li><a href="https://u.gg/lol/champions/annie/build" target="blank">Annie:</a>She isn’t the best mid-laner, but can be really good if you build her right, and can play with ranged champions, you can easily win your lane. </li>
                <li><a href="https://u.gg/lol/champions/galio/build" target="blank">Galio:</a>He can be a good support too, but I think he should be in mid. He’s a tank, but really strong.</li>

                <li><a href="https://u.gg/lol/champions/ashe/build" target="blank">Ashe:</a>She’s really overpowered, because she can show you a part of the map, can slow you with her passive, and damages enemies like a beast.</li>
